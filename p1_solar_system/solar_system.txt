Solar System 

Build an app that allows a user to travel and explore the solar system.

MVP

- The app should allow the user to create (discover) new planets and edit their properties (god-mode).
- The app should allow the user to travel from the sun to each planet and view information about the planet
- The app should allow the user to destroy any planetary body

Inspired (loosely) by games such as Elite Dangerous and Eve online.

Possible Extensions

- The app should allow the user to see a summary of their activities at the end of their visit
- The app should be able to include moons in a many to one relationship with planets
- Show distance to sun at each solar system object
